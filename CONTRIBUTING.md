# How to contribute
Third-party contributions are essential for keeping the Danish national patient register great.
We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute to get things working in your integration with the register.
There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.

## Code of conduct

## Identify your reporting authority
Most likely you're ultimately working on behalf of a reporting authority. Please identify the reporting authority when contributing. A workable identification can be your github account name, if you have a dedicated account that you use when submitting issues to the register, e.g. JohnDoeRegionMidt or JaneSmithVendorX.

## Submitting issues
