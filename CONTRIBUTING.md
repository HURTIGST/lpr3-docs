# How to contribute
Third-party contributions are essential for keeping the Danish national patient register great.
We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute to get things working in your integration with the register.
There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.

## Language
Use English language with the exception of LPR3 specific terminology, e.g. you can choose to use forl√∏b instead of episode of care.

## Identify your reporting authority
Most likely you're ultimately working on behalf of a reporting authority. Please identify the reporting authority when contributing. A workable identification can be your github account name, if you have a dedicated account that you use when submitting issues to the register, e.g. JohnDoeRegionMidt or JaneSmithVendorX.

## Submitting issues
Feel free to submit issues and keep in mind that that we have limited resource looking at issues.
Separate you issues. If you have multiple questions, bugs reports, enchancement request create sepearate issues for them.
If an issue is assigned to you react on it in the same time and way you would like us to react.
Finally, you're responsible for closing issues when you have no more relevant information to add.

**During the Danish holidays and vacation periods our effort spend on your contributions will be reduced.**

### Questions
If you can find an answer in the documentation or elsewhere try to refrain from posting a question. We will only answer questions directly concerning the technical parts of the interface the register, e.g. how to register data. If you're question is about what data to register contact the project group at Danish National Health Data Agency.

### Bugs
If you're expiriencing a bug please provide as much information as possible. These are often the entire XDR ITI-41 request and a precise time when the issue arose. We prefer times converted to Europe/Copenhagen time zone.

### Enhancement requests

### Service levels and performane
Topics concerning service levels and system performance such as throughput and response times must be adressed to the project group at the Danish National Health Data Agency.

## Pull requests
We love when people contribute to the documentation of the register :heart_eyes:
